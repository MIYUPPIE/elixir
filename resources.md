## 🎯 Skill Assessment Checklist

### Beginner ✅
- [ ] Can create variables and use basic data types
- [ ] Understands pattern matching
- [ ] Can write simple functions
- [ ] Knows how to use if/case/cond
- [ ] Familiar with lists and maps

### Intermediate ✅
- [ ] Comfortable with recursion
- [ ] Can use Enum and Stream effectively
- [ ] Can create and test Mix projects
- [ ] Understands error handling patterns
- [ ] Can write well-documented modules

### Advanced ✅
- [ ] Masters process spawning and message passing
- [ ] Can build GenServers and supervisors
- [ ] Understands OTP design principles

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Thinking imperatively** - Embrace functional patterns
2. **Avoiding pattern matching** - Use it everywhere!
3. **Ignoring documentation** - Write docs as you code
4. **Overusing processes** - Not everything needs to be a GenServer
5. **Premature optimization** - Focus on correctness first
6. **Neglecting tests** - Test-driven development pays off

## 🎉 Congratulations Milestones

- **First "Hello World"** 🎊
- **First successful pattern match** 🎯
- **First recursive function** 🔄
- **First Mix project** 📦
- **First GenServer** 🏗️
- **First Phoenix app** 🌐
- **First production deployment** 🚀

Remember: Learning Elixir is a journey, not a destination. The functional programming paradigm might feel different at first, but it becomes natural with practice. Focus on understanding the concepts rather than memorizing syntax.

Happy learning! 💜
