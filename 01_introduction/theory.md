# What is Elixir?

Elixir is a modern, functional programming language built on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM). It was created by Jos√© Valim in 2011 to bring modern language features to the proven Erlang ecosystem.

## Key Features

### üîÑ Functional Programming
- Immutable data structures
- Pattern matching
- Higher-order functions
- No side effects by default

### ‚ö° Concurrency & Fault Tolerance
- Lightweight processes (not OS threads!)
- Actor model for communication
- "Let it crash" philosophy
- Built-in supervision trees

### üìà Scalability
- Millions of processes on a single machine
- Hot code swapping (update code without stopping the system)
- Distributed by design

### üõ°Ô∏è Reliability
- Battle-tested Erlang VM (30+ years)
- Used in telecoms for 99.9999999% uptime
- Fault-tolerant by design
